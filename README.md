This repo seeks to emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required for a new bike system for TFL


**Skills demonstrated**

TDD -> learning to write Rspec tests first and foremost. This represents the logic when thinking about how one imagines the classes/methods to interact, and is used to steer how we define classes/methods
The art of test writing -> learning to write tests neatly, descriptively and concisely
Practicing OOD -> using different objects (class instances) and setting up interactions between them
Encapsulation -> understanding why certain getters (attr_readers) should be private (i.e. the user cannot access or edit class instance variables directly, and must use the prescribed methods pertinent to the class in question)



**Single Responsibility Principle
**

designing methods to perform a single responsibility. 

**Modules** 

Refactoring similar code into a module, that can then be imported back into the relevant classes. This displays an understanding of inheritance
Comments.(Inheritance) understanding how modules can be used as a single point of inheritance for multiple classes.
